This code aims to assess the accuracy of Skyfield's results when compared to data obtained from NASA's Horizon system. The code isn't displayed in its entirety here, as the intermediate "print" statements have been commented out for brevity. Additionally, the NASA Horizon data used in this comparison is sourced from a text file downloaded on September 1, 2023. The Two-Line Element Set (TLE) data, which is crucial for the calculations, has also been updated to match the same date.
